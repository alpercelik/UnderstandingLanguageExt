# Language.Ext for new developers

An initial tutorial showing how to use ideas such as pipelineing, delcarative style coding and walks through the fundamentals behind Select() SelectMany() and Bind() and Map() while covering implementation via Linq's Fluent and Linq Expression syntax.
The tutorials go through the followng concepts

* Tutorial01 - Construction of a Type with its own Select() function
* Tutorial02 - Shows you how to use Map and Bind (also construction of a Mondad Type)
* Tutorial03 - Shows how Bind is used to create a pipeline of function calls
* Tutorial04 - Performing operations on a Box using Map() and Bind(), Select and SelectMany()
* Tutorial05 - More examples of performing operations on a Box
* Tutorial06 - This tutorial shows you how pipelining is used to call funtions using Linq Fluent and Expression syntax
* Tutorial07 - Shows you when to use Map() and Bind()
* Tutorial08 - Shows you how to transition from Imperative style coding to Declarative style coding with an example
* Tutorial09 - Shows you that pipelines include automatic validation
* Tutorial10 - Expands on Tutorial09 to show that transofmration function always return a Monad
* Tutorial11 - Shows how monad built in validation, affords short-cuircuiting functionality.
* Tutorial12 - Pure Functions - immutable functions with now ide effects
* Tutorial13 - Partial Functions - Allowing multiple arguments to be 'baked' in and still appear as Math like functions
* Tutorial14 - Composition of functions
* Tutorial15 - language Ext - Either<L,R> and Option<T>
* Tutorial16 - Immutability - Smart constructors
* Tutorial17 - Caching
* Tutorial18 - Threading and parallelism benfits
* Tutorial19 - Guidelines for writing immutable code, starting with IO on the fringes (bycicle spoke design)
